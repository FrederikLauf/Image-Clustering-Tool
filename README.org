* Image Clustering Tool
A module and GUI for explorative image clustering, using algorithms for unsupervised machine learning provided by scikit-learn.

The result is visualised on a matplotlib frame as clusters of image thumbnails with coloured frames indicating the cluster membership. (The first two dimensions of the data are plotted.)

The clusters can be exported, i.e. the original images are copied to different subfolders according to their cluster membership.

The GUI is invoked by running app.py.

** Input fields on the GUI
- Scaler :: Select the scaler, which is applied to the data first.
- Decomposer :: Select the method for reducing the dimensionality of the data.
  - components :: Enter the number of dimensions for the reduced data (irrelevant for decomposer "TSNE"). (The visualisation will show only the first two dimensions.)
- Clusterer :: Select the clustering method.
  - n_clusters :: Enter the desired number of resulting clusters (irrelevant for clusterer "DBSCAN").
  - dbscan_min :: Enter the minimal cluster size for DBSCAN (irrelevant for other clusterers).  
  - dbscan_eps :: Enter the eps parameter ("cluster density") for DBSCAN (irrelevant for other clusterers).
- select folder :: Select a folder containing only image files for analysis.
- apply :: Perform and display clustering analysis on the currently selected images according to the current inputs.
- export :: Copy the original images into a subfolder of their current folder, distributed over further subfolders according to their cluster membership.
