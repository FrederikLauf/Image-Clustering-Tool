* Image Clustering Tool
A tool for explorative image clustering, using algorithms for unsupervised machine learning provided by scikit-learn.

The result is visualised on a matplotlib frame as clusters of image thumbnails with coloured frames indicating the cluster membership.
The plot is two-dimensional, but the viewing direction onto the higher-dimensional data can be selected via scrollbars.

The clusters can be exported, i.e. the original images are copied to different subfolders according to their cluster membership.

For better inspection, a cluster can be singled out and is re-plotted by clicking on a representative.
Clicking on an image in this view opens the orignal image in a separate window.
(The view of all clusters is recovered by re-applying the cluster analysis with the "apply" button.)

The GUI is invoked by running image_clustering_app.py.

** Input fields and other control elements on the GUI
- Scaler :: Select the scaler, which is applied to the data first.
- Decomposer :: Select the method for reducing the dimensionality of the data.
  - components :: Enter the number of dimensions for the reduced data (irrelevant for decomposer "TSNE").
- Clusterer :: Select the clustering method.
  - n_clusters :: Enter the desired number of resulting clusters (irrelevant for clusterer "DBSCAN").
  - dbscan_min :: Enter the minimal cluster size for DBSCAN (irrelevant for other clusterers).  
  - dbscan_eps :: Enter the eps parameter ("cluster density") for DBSCAN (irrelevant for other clusterers).
- select folder :: Select a folder with image files for analysis.
- apply :: Perform and display clustering analysis on the currently selected images according to the current inputs.
- export :: Copy the original images into a subfolder of their current folder, distributed over further subfolders according to their cluster membership.
- scrollbars :: Select the dimension of the reduced data to be displayed on the respective axis of the plot.
- slider "image size" :: Determine the size of the image thumbnails which are loaded and used as the data for clustering. For value n, the images are sized to (n, 2n/3) regardless of their original format.
- slider "image display scaling" ::  Scale the size of the thumbnails shown in the plot.
